- *Smooth Transitions*: Weapons are switched with smooth animations and feedback.
- *Customizable UI*: The weapon wheel interface is fully customizable to support different types of weapons and actions.
- *Audio & Visual Effects*: Includes sound effects and animations for selecting weapons, ensuring a satisfying player experience.
- *Support for Multiple Weapons*: The system can handle various weapon types (e.g., pistols, rifles, melee weapons).

How It Works

Weapon Wheel Functionality

The weapon wheel works by creating a radial menu in the center of the screen. It is activated by the player’s input (e.g., holding down a button). The wheel displays a set of weapons, which the player can select by moving the cursor or using controller input.

Radial Menu System: Utilizes Unreal’s UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) system for building the wheel.

Weapon Switching: Once a weapon is selected, the game’s inventory is updated, and the new weapon is equipped with visual and sound feedback.


Input and Controls

The project supports the following controls for interacting with the weapon wheel:

PC:

Mouse: Hover over the wheel options and click to select a weapon.

Keyboard: Press and hold the TAB key to activate the wheel, and use arrow keys to navigate.


Controller:

Press and hold the assigned weapon wheel button to activate the wheel. Use the left analog stick to select the weapon.
